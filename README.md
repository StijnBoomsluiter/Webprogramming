Advertisements of Coolblue for Webprogramming. 

## Overview
This project contains five advertisements created for Coolblue as part of the Webprogramming school project. Each advertisement is designed to promote different products or services offered by Coolblue.

## Advertisement Details

### Advertisement 1:
I created this advertisement to develop an interactive experience. I wanted users to have choices between buttons, and subsequently, the price would fly in. This goal was successfully achieved in this advertisement.

### Advertisement 2:
While seeking inspiration, I observed several advertisements structured in a similar way. Hence, I created an ad with a similar layout, adding hover effects and using GSAP to continuously scale an object for visual appeal.

### Advertisement 3:
With this advertisement, I aimed to create an improved version of the first ad. I achieved this by adding extra elements using GSAP. For instance, balloons descend from above after clicking one of the buttons, and a blinking effect is applied to the price tag.

### Advertisement 4:
This advertisement is also structured based on inspiration. I added a GIF and implemented object blinking to introduce movement. Additionally, I incorporated some hover effects for an enhanced user experience.

### Advertisement 5:
For this ad, I opted for a different dimension, adding diversity to the set. Unique GSAP effects were applied, such as the text flying in from the left and the image slowly sliding from left to right.
